A discontinued minecraft plugin for spigot... its supposed to be for a minigame called "anchorwars" that I created

**FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT TRY TO RUN THIS**

I am publishing this kinda just as a memo, how bad my code was.. I started this project with barely any programming knowledge and **absolutely no** knowledge about java...

So feel free to laugh at my code I guess xd

for context, I worked on this from like **August of 2021** to november of 2021... Only later I decided to add it to github and refactor it a bit  (and publish it now...)
